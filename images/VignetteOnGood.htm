style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Vignette
on Good</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Joe was taken aback to hear his cat had been mauled by
a horse. Tweetums had survived, but only because Ms. Harisinghani had saved him
from the swollen purple gums gnawing on Tweetums through the wrought-iron fence
that surrounded her yard. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Standing idly at attention in his doorway,
Joe thought of the just-bloomed orchid that Tweetums had savagely incorporated
the day before, and maybe he deserved his mastication a little. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Ms. Harisinghani held out a large Star
Market paper bag—gently twitching—and Joe looked in upon an orchid colored cat.
He looked back up at Ms. Harisinghani who was apologizing profusely: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            I will punish Posy; I will spank Posy; I
will bury Posy while she sleeps and leave only her nostrils above ground for a
week. Her tears matched her dress: delicate, and a little see-through. Joe
looked away, his eyes drawn back to the slowly dampening brown paper bag with a
brown-blue star.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Why don’t you come in, he mumbled apologetically
to the bag as he flapped lamely with  it toward his kitchen. Ms. Harisinghani’s
eyes weren’t on the bag. They were on Joe. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Okay, she smiled, perhaps we could decide
how to punish the pony over a cup of coffee. Feeling out of breath, Joe closed
the tight New England air out behind them. The walls were covered in black ink
cat-footprint batik art. The windows were crowded with viny flowers. Tweetums
was set on the coffee table and left to recover. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Joe watched the little woman rush
haphazardly around his kitchen as one does when trying to appear able to cook
without knowing that kitchen’s layout in the slightest. Cabinets opened and
slammed and Ms. Harisinghani tripped across Joe’s lumpy linoleum, almost
gracefully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            What do you do for fun, Joe?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Slam. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Joe was more interested in how the morning
light silhouetted Ms. Harisinghani through her dress as she clumsily danced
past his window. Her armpit. Her knee. Her breast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I like to paint with my
cat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Slam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            How wonderful! I used to have a little dog
once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Slam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            I was so young, I’ve forgotten his name.
But he used to jump up onto my mantlepiece and sit so still until I would draw
him. I wasn’t very good, of course, but it satisfied him, and he would jump
down straight onto my head, wriggling around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            Sounds like a cute dog. As her eyes held
his for a moment, Joe hoped she was seeing her beloved pet. He had been told by
several girlfriends and one aunt that his eyes were lovely and soft and wet.
Tell me about your dog, Ms. Harisinghani. The coffee was ready now, and they
moved to the small table. Their knees collided and their eyes met over the top
of the still rustling Star Market bag, now leaking through the bottom like a
rotisserie had cracked open during a fast dash through the parking lot. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            He was a sweet dog, Ms. Harisinghani replied,
He would always nuzzle my hand for treats. Ms. Harisinghani’s hand free hand
left her mug and lighted itself, wrist first, on the edge of the table in order
to avoid the red-blue ooze. Joe quickly grabbed her hand—a little less
deftly—and the plastic buttons on his cuff scooped a little of the puddle. Ms.
Harisinghani was smiling off at dog heaven:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            He was a very sweet dog, but such a
rascal. He loved us to death, but he terrorized the neighborhood cats. Ms.
Harisinghani stopped herself, shock behind her glasses, and snatched her hand
away, knocking the bag on its side. A matted tail rolled out onto the table.
I’m so sorry, I forgot. I just forgot. Ms. Harisinghani looked distraught. Joe
felt foiled. The tail tapped a single beat of morse code on the table. Joe, I
just don’t understand why Posy would do this, Ms. Harisinghani spoke softly,
through the holes between her teeth. Joe—a quiet and thoughtless man—took his
time before answering, in an effort to impress her:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>            People sometimes say that horses are
harmless, just big dogs. But what if dogs are just small horses?</span></p>
